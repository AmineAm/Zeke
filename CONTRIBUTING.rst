*Zeke*: The Zombie Epidemic Modeling Platform
====

Contributing:
-------------
*Zeke* is an open-source project, and actively welcomes new contributors. Interested users are invited to contribute new models, improved front end code, or new back-end implementations to improve performance.

PULL REQUEST RULES STUFF HERE

Additionally, interested users are encouraged to fork *Zeke* for use as the front-end for other, subject-specific modeling projects (ex. theoretical ecology using predator-prey models rather than epidemic models).

Contributing Guidelines:
------------------------
* When at all possible, *Zeke* strives to use standard, well-supported tools that are part of the Python scientific computing ecosystem. The standard libraries we use are NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, as well as Django for front-end work. If a new model, back end feature etc. requires the use of another library, please make a note of this in the pull request, as well as a rational for why the use of this library is necessary.
* Please keep all bug reports, pull requests and other contributions respectful. Criticism and constructive advice is welcome - abuse is not.
* Please use gender-neutral and inclusive language in all documentation (including vignettes, within-code comments, variable names, etc.), code, and other contributions.
